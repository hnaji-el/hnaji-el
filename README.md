👋 Hi, I am a software engineer with a focus on full-stack web development, committed to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions with clean, structured code that directly addresses the core problems.

## About Me

I mainly work with React for front-end development and Node.js/Express.js/NestJS for back-end development, along with databases, Git, Docker, and various other tools. In addition, I have built many projects using C and C++.

I have a deep curiosity to understand how underlying technologies work because that leads me to appreciate the abstractions better.

I am also passionate about contributing to the real world in meaningful ways. My goal is to add value through my work and efforts, striving to make a positive impact on society.
